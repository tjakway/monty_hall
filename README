Simulates the Monty Hall Paradox.  From wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#The_paradox):

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? (Whitaker, 1990, as quoted by vos Savant 1990a)

The paradox is that, intuitively, switch doors should not matter and you should win a car regardless of what you do.  In reality, not switching gives you the correct answer only 33% of the time and switching makes you win 66% of the time.

Uses ISAAC (public domain) for random number generation.  See http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html.

DEPENDENCIES:
cmake >2.8 to build
(ISAAC is in included as source files in include/ and src/, no installation necessary)

BUILDING:

(NOTE: only builds for x86 (32 bit) because ISAAC only typedefs its values--it's not really platform independent.  Get ISAAC64 and change the ISAAC calls to the appropriate ISAAC64 to build for x86-64)

mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake -GUnix\ Makefiles -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
./monty_hall_simulator

Tested on Linux (Ubuntu 14.10) and Mac

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Running the simulator the default number of times (2000000).  Pass --count <number> to run the simulation <number> of times, first with the player switching doors, then without.
